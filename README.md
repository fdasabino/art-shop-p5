## Project Goals

- Hi there! Welcome to Daniela's Art Shop.
  I have put together an ecommerce webpage that intends to satisfy the requirements of the project milestone 5 of the Code
  Institute.
  In this page you will find a fully functional ecommerce website. The main goal with this project is to create a small
  size ecommerce store that sells original paintings and prints, created by the artist.

- Generally speaking I believe the project to bring the feeling of a small art store, with personal touch, going away
  from the usual conventions in some cases. there are few implementations that i would like to do in the future, but due
  to time constraints they will have to be implemented in a near future.

## Deployed Application

  dropdown menu and click register, to be transferred to the allauth default account creation links.

## Test Payments with Stripe

- As a simple example of the functionality of the application, users can add products to their shopping cart, and make
  test purchases.
- The card numbers below are provided by a third party software called Stripe to allow testing while implementing the
  payment functionality:

|       Event Type:        |   Card Number:   |
| :----------------------: | :--------------: |
|   Successful payment:    | 4242424242424242 |
| Requires authentication: | 4000002500003155 |
|     Failed payment:      | 4000000000009995 |

## UX

- Given this application is for an art ecommerce website, the design is very product centered. It has been
  designed to enable a customer to add items to their basket, and checkout and pay as seamlessly as possible. All
  pertinent product information is highlighted upfront, for example, price, size and product uniqueness to keep customers informed.
