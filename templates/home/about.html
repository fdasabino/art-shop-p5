                  <p class="mt-5 text-justify">Hi, my name is <b>Daniela Kronvall</b>. I am an
                    abstract artist based in
                    Stockholm. My brush transforms whatever comes to me through meditation and powerful feeling onto a
                    canvas in
                    glitzy shades. In my meditation I let go of everything. I am free from my past and my future.
                    I am only me in the present. There I let myself be no one and nobody I forgive and
                    heal. In that space there is no judgement. There is only high vibrations of
                    love, gratitude, acceptance, happiness and serenity like an ocean of emotion which I transform into
                    vibrant colors and shapes.</p>

                  <P class="text-justify">
                    I love to inspire and motivate people to reach higher, to raise energy above and beyond and
                    to grow emotional intelligence. Every day is a new opportunity to learn. My
                    interests are within the fields of neuropsychology, positive psychology, mindfulness, neuroscience
                    and quantum field.
                  </P>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    Besides having the passion for psychology and art I also have the passion for teaching. On a
                    daily basis I teach Psychology and English within Adult Education. I believe that we can become
                    whatever we want if we have faith in the power of the mind. So, when we set our minds towards growth
                    and prosperity, there are only possibilities ahead and we can all use our creativity as a tool to
                    get
                    in touch with ourselves and others.
                  </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">
                    This is why I paint. My desire is strong. I grow every time I paint. I love to be in that creative
                    flow,
                    in that magical positive vibration where I get in touch with the essence of me and the only thing I
                    feel is pure happiness â€“ pure love!! And I take that happiness with me everywhere I go.
